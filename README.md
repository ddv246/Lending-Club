It is important to be able to estimate credit risk of each borrower as precisely as possible.
Hence, our project focuses on modelling three different classification models namely Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree.
Our goal is to determine whether a borrower will default or not on the basis of several factors such as income, age, location and interest rate.
We will also compare the three models to determine the best model on the basis of AUC score and cross validation score.
